# Text Adventure Game

This is a simple text adventure game where the player navigates through a series of rooms and encounters obstacles and challenges.

## Usage

To use this app, simply run the script. You'll be presented with a description of the current room and asked which direction you want to go. Enter "north", "south", "east", or "west" to move in that direction.

The game is over when you reach the end of the maze or if you get lost.
